# Lean design implementation

User authorization: implement all recommendations in the 2026-09-28 lean architecture report.
Starting source: `67cbc2e9`, existing branch `codex/research-grade-design-system`.
Research: `output/research/2026-09-28-lean-design-architecture/REPORT.md` and its retained evidence.

## Scope and completion ledger

The entire six-package objective remains active. Source implementation, local qualification,
native capability admission, human quality evaluation and production admission are separate evidence.
No package is complete merely because a smaller test passes.

| Package | Scope | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Preserve uncertain Canva effects, current native revision basis and unrelated manual edits | In progress: uncertainty slice locally qualified; native revision preservation open | ADR-108; CANVA_UNCERTAINTY_PROOF.json |
| 2 | Complete brief handoff, full copy geometry, scoped visual references/photo meaning, faithful refinement assets | Open | Research probe identifies current losses |
| 3 | Free feasibility before art, eligible-only judging, retained typed responses, pinned derivations, safe bounded concurrency | Open | No new implementation evidence |
| 4 | Amend/Adapt routing and actual Canva account capability qualification | Open | Official documentation is not account admission |
| 5 | Relationship-led composition, calibrated selection, governed edit learning and equal-budget human comparisons | Open | Existing R04–R06/R13/R22–R25 study machinery must be reused |
| 6 | Complete supervised native review/delivery, release qualification and independent recovery | Open | Prior qualification remains scoped to its own candidate |

## First slice: creation uncertainty

Requirements: FR-060, NFR-001, NFR-020, NFR-024; R07/R21.
Normative sources: `MASTER_SPEC.md`, `docs/10_WORKFLOW_RELIABILITY.md`,
`docs/30_CURRENT_STUDIO_CONTRACT.md`, linked through `plans/traceability.csv`.

Acceptance: no second design after lost creation reply, age/sweep, missing job read,
authorization failure or a legacy failed record without positive failure evidence.
Definite provider refusal/failure stays retryable under a new key; an explicit resume
can recover the original job without another creation. Polling is bounded and the
operator sees what requires reconciliation. Concurrent success must not be demoted.

## Verification policy

Use directly affected fake-provider/PostgreSQL tests first, preserve failures, then
source/test type and architecture checks. Perform full candidate qualification once
the integrated release is ready. Paid/native calls need the already required scoped
budget and actual application capabilities; human approvals cannot be substituted.

## 2026-09-28 — First implementation checkpoint

ADR-108 is implemented and locally qualified: uncertain outcomes and historical
failed records without positive evidence cannot permit another design creation.
An explicit original-job check recovers work; polling stops after a durable hold;
Desk explains reconciliation. Pure policy rejects mismatched job evidence and
contradictory returned design identity. Late sweep/read results preserve concurrent
completion. Existing export recovery semantics remain separate.

Six new cases failed before the source correction. Final affected acceptance:
23 files, 296 passed, zero failed/skipped; 514 strict test roots and Desk build pass.
Initial sandbox PostgreSQL/tsx-IPC failures and superseded expectations are retained
in the proof. Source/scripts types, any-count and provider-egress checks passed.
No full release qualification, production deployment, paid calls, native manual
recovery or human-quality study occurred. See `CANVA_UNCERTAINTY_PROOF.json`.

Next: qualify current native revision admission and preservation, then complete
brief/visual handoffs and remove unnecessary creative work. The full six-package
objective remains active; this checkpoint is not a completion claim.
